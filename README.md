# Drakeor's 8080 Emulator
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/drakeor/drakeor-8080-emulator.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/drakeor/drakeor-8080-emulator)

Yet another Intel 8080 emulator written in C. 
It's built to run on one of my micro controllers hence the small footprint.
I built it to run Space Invaders for a project I'm working on.

# Libraries
Uses [MinUnit](http://www.jera.com/techinfo/jtns/jtn002.html) for unit testing.
